# Advanced Prompting Techniques

## Overview
Advanced prompting techniques go beyond basic instruction-giving to leverage sophisticated methods that dramatically improve AI output quality, consistency, and reliability. These techniques are essential for professional-grade AI interactions.

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

### What is Chain-of-Thought?
Chain-of-Thought prompting encourages the AI to show its reasoning process step-by-step, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, especially for complex problems.

### Basic CoT Pattern
```
Solve this problem step by step:
[Problem statement]

First, let me break this down:
1. [Identify key components]
2. [Analyze relationships]
3. [Apply relevant principles]
4. [Calculate/determine result]
5. [Verify the solution]

Show your work for each step.
```

### Advanced CoT with Self-Verification
```
You are solving [COMPLEX_PROBLEM]. Use the following approach:

Step 1: Problem Analysis
- Break down the problem into components
- Identify what information is given vs. what needs to be found
- Note any constraints or assumptions

Step 2: Solution Development
- Outline your approach
- Work through the solution methodically
- Show all calculations/reasoning

Step 3: Self-Check
- Verify your answer makes logical sense
- Check if it meets all stated requirements
- Identify potential errors or oversights

Step 4: Alternative Approaches
- Consider if there's another way to solve this
- Compare results if applicable
- Explain why your chosen method is optimal
```

## Few-Shot Learning Patterns

### The Three-Example Template
```
I need you to [TASK_DESCRIPTION]. Here are examples of the desired format:

Example 1:
Input: [Example input 1]
Output: [Example output 1]

Example 2:
Input: [Example input 2]
Output: [Example output 2]

Example 3:
Input: [Example input 3]
Output: [Example output 3]

Now, please apply the same pattern to:
Input: [Your actual input]
Output: [Let AI generate]
```

### Progressive Complexity Examples
```
I need you to create [DELIVERABLE] following this pattern of increasing complexity:

Simple Example:
[Basic version with explanation]

Intermediate Example:
[More complex version with additional features]

Advanced Example:
[Most complex version with full features]

Now create a [COMPLEXITY_LEVEL] version for: [YOUR_SPECIFIC_CASE]
```

## Role-Based Prompting with Constraints

### The Expert Panel Approach
```
You are a panel of three experts discussing [TOPIC]:

Expert 1: [Role/Background] - Focus on [Perspective 1]
Expert 2: [Role/Background] - Focus on [Perspective 2]  
Expert 3: [Role/Background] - Focus on [Perspective 3]

Each expert should:
1. Present their viewpoint based on their expertise
2. Challenge or build upon others' points
3. Provide specific examples from their field
4. Reach a consensus recommendation

Format as a structured discussion with clear expert voices.
```

### The Constrained Expert Pattern
```
You are a [EXPERT_ROLE] with these specific constraints:
- Experience level: [YEARS/EXPERTISE_LEVEL]
- Industry focus: [SPECIFIC_INDUSTRY]
- Methodology preference: [PREFERRED_APPROACHES]
- Available resources: [BUDGET/TIME/TOOLS]
- Regulatory requirements: [COMPLIANCE_NEEDS]
- Risk tolerance: [CONSERVATIVE/MODERATE/AGGRESSIVE]

Given these constraints, how would you approach [SPECIFIC_CHALLENGE]?

Requirements:
- Solutions must be practical within stated constraints
- Justify recommendations based on your specified background
- Address potential objections from stakeholders
- Provide implementation timeline
```

## Meta-Prompting Techniques

### The Self-Improving Prompt
```
Your task is to [MAIN_OBJECTIVE]. Before providing your response:

1. Analyze this prompt for clarity and completeness
2. Identify any missing information that would improve your response
3. Ask clarifying questions if needed
4. Provide your best response based on available information
5. Suggest how this prompt could be improved for future use

This meta-analysis should help you give a more thoughtful and complete response.
```

### The Quality Assurance Wrapper
```
You will complete [TASK] following this quality assurance process:

Phase 1: Initial Response
[Provide your initial solution]

Phase 2: Critical Review
- What assumptions did you make?
- What could go wrong with this approach?
- What alternative solutions exist?
- How confident are you in this solution (1-10)?

Phase 3: Refined Response
[Provide improved solution based on your review]

Phase 4: Implementation Notes
- Key risks to monitor
- Success metrics
- Recommended next steps
```

## Structured Output Techniques

### The JSON Schema Pattern
```
Generate a response following this exact JSON schema:

{
  "analysis": {
    "problem_statement": "string",
    "key_factors": ["array", "of", "strings"],
    "risk_level": "high|medium|low"
  },
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "priority": "1-5",
      "timeline": "string",
      "resources_needed": ["array"]
    }
  ],
  "success_metrics": {
    "primary": "string",
    "secondary": ["array", "of", "strings"]
  }
}

Input: [YOUR_SPECIFIC_SITUATION]
```

### The Template Filling Pattern
```
Fill out this strategic planning template for [YOUR_PROJECT]:

## SITUATION ANALYSIS
Current State: [2-3 sentences]
Desired State: [2-3 sentences]
Gap Analysis: [Key differences]

## STRATEGIC OPTIONS
Option 1: [Name] - [Brief description] - [Pros/Cons]
Option 2: [Name] - [Brief description] - [Pros/Cons]
Option 3: [Name] - [Brief description] - [Pros/Cons]

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH
Selected Option: [Choice with rationale]
Implementation Plan: [5 key steps]
Resource Requirements: [What's needed]
Timeline: [Realistic timeframe]
Success Metrics: [How to measure]

## RISK MITIGATION
Primary Risks: [Top 3 concerns]
Mitigation Strategies: [Specific actions]
Contingency Plans: [If things go wrong]
```

## Iterative Refinement Techniques

### The Iterative Improvement Loop
```
I need you to develop [SOLUTION] using this iterative approach:

Iteration 1: Basic Framework
- Create a simple, working version
- Focus on core functionality
- Identify obvious gaps or issues

Iteration 2: Enhanced Version  
- Address the gaps from iteration 1
- Add important features
- Consider user feedback/requirements

Iteration 3: Optimized Version
- Refine based on iteration 2
- Optimize for efficiency/effectiveness
- Add polish and edge case handling

For each iteration, explain:
- What you improved and why
- What trade-offs you made
- What still needs work
```

### The Progressive Detail Pattern
```
Develop [CONCEPT] with increasing levels of detail:

Level 1: Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
[High-level concept]

Level 2: Strategic Overview (1 paragraph)
[Key components and relationships]

Level 3: Tactical Details (Multiple paragraphs)
[Specific implementation details]

Level 4: Operational Specifics (Detailed breakdown)
[Step-by-step processes, metrics, resources]

Each level should build naturally on the previous one.
```

## Contextual Prompting

### The Situational Context Pattern
```
Context Setting:
- Industry: [SPECIFIC_INDUSTRY]
- Company size: [STARTUP/SME/ENTERPRISE]
- Market conditions: [CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT]
- Internal capabilities: [STRENGTHS/LIMITATIONS]
- Competitive pressure: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
- Regulatory environment: [RELEVANT_REGULATIONS]
- Cultural factors: [ORGANIZATIONAL_CULTURE]

Given this specific context, how would you approach [CHALLENGE]?

Important: Your recommendations must be realistic and achievable within this context. Generic advice won't work here.
```

### The Stakeholder Perspective Pattern
```
Analyze [SITUATION] from multiple stakeholder perspectives:

Customer Perspective:
- What do they care about most?
- How does this impact their experience?
- What are their likely concerns?

Employee Perspective:
- How does this affect daily work?
- What skills/training might be needed?
- What resistance might emerge?

Management Perspective:
- What are the financial implications?
- How does this support strategic goals?
- What are the success metrics?

Partner/Vendor Perspective:
- How are relationships affected?
- What new requirements emerge?
- What opportunities or risks arise?

Synthesize into balanced recommendations that address all perspectives.
```

## Quality Control Techniques

### The Red Team Review
```
You will provide a solution to [PROBLEM], then conduct a "red team" review of your own work.

Initial Solution:
[Provide your best solution]

Red Team Analysis:
Now, act as a critical reviewer and identify:
1. Potential failure points in this solution
2. Assumptions that might be wrong
3. Unintended consequences
4. Better alternatives that might exist
5. Implementation challenges

Revised Solution:
Based on the red team review, provide an improved solution that addresses the identified concerns.
```

### The Sanity Check Pattern
```
Before finalizing any response about [TOPIC], run through this sanity check:

Reality Check:
- Is this actually feasible?
- Do the numbers/timeline/resources make sense?
- Have I considered regulatory/legal constraints?

Stakeholder Check:
- Would the key stakeholders actually accept this?
- Are there political/cultural barriers I'm missing?
- What would cause this to be rejected?

Implementation Check:
- Is this specific enough to act on?
- Are there obvious gaps in the plan?
- What would someone need to know to execute this?

Only provide solutions that pass all three checks.
```
