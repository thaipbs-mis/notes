# AI Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

## What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to get the best possible outputs from AI language models. It's both an art and a science that involves understanding how AI models interpret and respond to different types of instructions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity and Specificity
- **Be explicit** about what you want
- **Provide context** for better understanding
- **Define the scope** of the task clearly
- **Specify the format** you want for the output

### 2. Structure and Organization
- Use **clear sections** and bullet points
- **Number steps** when sequence matters
- **Separate different types** of information
- **Use consistent formatting** throughout

### 3. Context Setting
- **Define the role** the AI should take
- **Provide background information** relevant to the task
- **Set the tone** and style expectations
- **Specify the target audience**

## Basic Prompt Components

### Essential Elements
1. **Role Definition**: "You are a [role]..."
2. **Task Description**: "Your task is to..."
3. **Context**: "Given that..."
4. **Constraints**: "You must/must not..."
5. **Output Format**: "Present the results as..."

### Advanced Elements
- **Examples** (few-shot prompting)
- **Chain-of-thought** reasoning
- **Error handling** instructions
- **Evaluation criteria**

## Common Prompt Patterns

### The Professional Role Pattern
```
You are a [professional role] with [years] of experience in [field].
Your task is to [specific task].
Consider [relevant factors].
Present your response in [format].
```

### The Step-by-Step Pattern
```
Please complete this task in the following steps:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Final step]

For each step, explain your reasoning.
```

### The Constraint Pattern
```
Create [deliverable] with the following constraints:
- Budget: [amount]
- Timeline: [timeframe]
- Target audience: [description]
- Must include: [requirements]
- Must avoid: [restrictions]
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ **Test and iterate** your prompts
- ✅ **Use specific examples** when possible
- ✅ **Break complex tasks** into smaller parts
- ✅ **Provide clear success criteria**
- ✅ **Consider edge cases** and exceptions

### Don'ts
- ❌ **Don't be vague** or ambiguous
- ❌ **Don't overload** with too much information
- ❌ **Don't assume** the AI knows your context
- ❌ **Don't ignore** the importance of formatting
- ❌ **Don't forget** to specify constraints
